# Eggless Red Velvet Cake

 **Course** : Dessert

 **Cuisine** : American

 **Servings** : 12 cupcakes or 1/2 kg cake approx.



## Ingredients

* 105 g all-purpose flour

- 120 g granulated white sugar

- 1 tbsp. unsweetened Cocoa Powder

- 1/4 tsp Baking powder

- 1/4 tsp Baking Soda

- 1/4 tsp salt

- 1/2 cup milk

- 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar, *regular works fine too*

- 40 ml oil, *2 tbsp. + 2 tsp*

- 1 tsp Vanilla extract

- few drops of Red food colour, *preferably the gel paste kind, they don’t dilute the batter*

- 1 batch of your favourite frosting 

  

## Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Prepare a 12-muffin pan with cupcake liners/mould.

2. In a bowl, sift all the dry ingredients – flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, add the vinegar to milk and leave it aside for 5 minutes. Once the milk is curdled (buttermilk is ready), combine oil, vanilla & food colour to it and whisk well.

4. Add the wet ingredients into dry and mix until combined. Make sure you don’t over-mix it - as soon as the baking soda and acid in buttermilk meet, they start working their magic by creating bubbles which we don’t want to lose even before the cake/cupcakes are in the oven!

5. Pour the mixture into a mould/cupcake liners not more than two-thirds of the way (it rises a lot in the oven).

6. Bake the cake/cupcakes for around 18-20 minutes at 160°C. A skewer inserted will come out clean, the cake/cupcakes will be shiny and springy to touch. Cool them for about 5 minutes in the pan and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

#### Frosting

-  Prepare your piping bag with your choice of a nozzle. Add your frosting and pipe them onto the cooled cake/cupcakes.
